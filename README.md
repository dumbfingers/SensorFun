In this project, I have used several third-party libraries, which are listed below:

* [ActionBarSherlock](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock)
* [android-switch-backport](https://github.com/BoD/android-switch-backport)
* [OpenCSV](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net)
* [GraphView](http://android-graphview.org)
